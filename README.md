# NEDAL ELABID — Portfolio & CMS

Personal brand platform for **NEDAL ELABID / نضال الأبيض** — Marketing Manager,
Growth Marketer, Creative Director — built as two connected halves:

1. a **premium public portfolio** (Executive Cyberpunk × Marketing Intelligence
   direction, English + Arabic with correct RTL), and
2. a **protected CMS dashboard** at `/admin` where every project, client,
   service, skill, metric, social link and line of copy is edited — no code
   changes, no redeploy.

A logged-in admin can create a project, upload its media, publish it, and see it
live on `/projects` and `/projects/<slug>` immediately. The same is true for
clients, services, skills, metrics, navigation, social links and site copy.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + a token-based design system in `src/app/globals.css` |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| Type | JetBrains Mono (Latin) · IBM Plex Sans Arabic (Arabic) |
| Data | Supabase (Postgres + Storage) when configured, file-backed JSON otherwise |
| Auth | Server-side session cookie (HMAC-signed, httpOnly), scrypt password hash |

> The original brief specified React 18 + Vite. Next.js was chosen instead so the
> dashboard's authentication and CRUD run **on the server** (no service-role key
> in the browser) and so each case study gets real per-page SEO metadata. Every
> other requirement in the brief is unchanged.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # optional for local dev — see below
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

With no environment variables at all, the app runs on the **file adapter**
(`data/cms.json`, seeded on first boot) and the dashboard accepts the local
development credentials:

```
http://localhost:3000/admin
email:    admin@nedal.local
password: nedal-dev-admin
```

Those dev defaults are refused when `NODE_ENV=production`.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev         # development server
npm run build       # production build
npm start           # run the production build
npm run lint        # eslint
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run smoke       # end-to-end check against a running server (see below)
npm run admin:hash -- "your-password"   # print ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH + ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
```

---

## Environment variables

All optional locally; the admin ones are **required in production**.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Absolute site URL — canonical/OG URLs, `sitemap.xml` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | The single admin account's email |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | `scrypt:<salt>:<key>` from `npm run admin:hash` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Plain-text alternative — development only |
| `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` | 32+ random chars; signs the session cookie |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-only key; never exposed to the browser |
| `SUPABASE_MEDIA_BUCKET` | Storage bucket for uploads (default `media`) |
| `CMS_DATA_FILE` | Override the JSON file path (file adapter only) |

Set up the admin account:

```bash
npm run admin:hash -- "a-long-password"
# ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=scrypt:…
# ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=…
```

## Database setup (Supabase)

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Open the SQL editor and run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql). It
   creates every collection table, the `updated_at` triggers, row-level security
   (anonymous clients can read published rows only; all writes require the
   service role), the unique project-slug index and the public `media` storage
   bucket.
3. Put `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the
   environment. The app switches adapters automatically — no code changes.
4. First boot with an empty database shows empty collections; seed content by
   entering it in the dashboard, or copy `data/cms.json` values across.

### Why an adapter layer

`src/lib/cms/store.ts` defines one `CmsStore` interface. Two implementations
live in `src/lib/cms/adapters/`:

* `supabase-store.ts` — Postgres via Supabase (production).
* `json-store.ts` — a real file-backed store for local development and
  single-node hosts. It re-reads the file when it changes on disk, writes
  atomically, and reports `writable: false` (surfaced in the dashboard header)
  on a read-only filesystem. It is **not** suitable for serverless or
  multi-instance deployments — use Supabase there.

Swapping in another backend means writing one more implementation of that
interface; no page, component or form changes.

## Project structure

```
src/
  app/
    (site)/                 public site: /, /about, /services, /projects,
                            /projects/[slug], /clients, /contact
    admin/
      (auth)/login          sign-in
      (dashboard)/          guarded dashboard
        [collection]/       list · new · edit for every collection
        content/            hero & site copy (EN + AR)
        media/              media library
        settings/           SEO, contact, appearance, sections
      actions.ts            all server actions (auth + CRUD)
    api/contact             public inquiry endpoint (validated + sanitized)
    api/admin/media         authenticated upload endpoint
  components/
    public/                 hero, sections, navbar, footer, forms
    admin/                  shell, sidebar, generic doc form, media picker
    ui/                     container, reveal, count-up, decor, empty states
  lib/
    cms/                    types, seed data, collections config, store, queries
    auth.ts                 session + password verification
    locale.ts / i18n.ts     locale cookie, RTL direction, copy accessor
supabase/schema.sql         database + storage setup
scripts/smoke.mjs           end-to-end verification
```

The dashboard is **descriptor-driven**: `src/lib/cms/collections.ts` declares the
fields of each collection and the list/edit screens render themselves from it, so
adding a content field is a one-line change.

---

## Content model

`projects · clients · services · skills · tools · experience · testimonials ·
metrics · social_links · navigation_items · media_assets · site_content ·
site_settings · inquiries`

Every text field that appears on the site exists in **both English and Arabic**;
an empty language falls back to the other one. Projects relate to a client and to
the services delivered by id, never by duplicated text.

### What ships seeded, and what does not

Seeded from the brief: the 16 services, the capability matrix, the five known
clients, the seven confirmed metrics, the six social links, navigation, and all
hero/section copy.

Deliberately **empty**: projects, experience, testimonials and tools. Nothing was
invented — the site renders elegant empty states until real records are entered.
The same applies to imagery: `public/images/portrait-*.svg` are placeholders.

### Adding the real portrait

1. Sign in → **Media library** → upload the portrait(s).
2. **Settings → Imagery** → set *Hero portrait* (and optionally *Hero spotlight
   reveal*, which is revealed by the cursor spotlight) and *About portrait*.

The hero is designed for a cinematic, high-contrast editorial portrait with black
clothing and deep shadows; the layout keeps negative space for the typography and
lays the red/orange glow behind the subject.

---

## Language & RTL

A cookie (`nedal_locale`) holds the reader's choice; the navbar toggle sets it and
the tree re-renders. Without a cookie the site uses the dashboard's default
language. `<html lang dir>` follows the locale, and the layout uses logical CSS
properties throughout, so Arabic mirrors correctly.

---

## Accessibility & performance

Semantic landmarks and headings, skip link, keyboard-navigable menus and
controls, visible focus rings, labelled form fields with accessible error
messages, alt text on meaningful images, `aria-hidden` on decoration.

`prefers-reduced-motion` disables the hero's pointer effects, the counters and
every reveal. All pointer-driven motion runs in a single `requestAnimationFrame`
loop that is cleaned up on unmount, paused when the tab is hidden and skipped on
touch devices. Below-the-fold media is lazy-loaded.

---

## Verification

With a server running (`npm run build && npm start`):

```bash
npm run smoke
```

`scripts/smoke.mjs` drives a real browser through: every public route in both
languages, horizontal-overflow checks at 1280px and 390px, the admin redirect for
anonymous visitors, sign-in, creating and publishing a project, seeing it on the
listing, the homepage and its case-study page, unpublishing it (public 404),
deleting it, uploading and deleting a media asset, the contact form's success
state, and a console-error check. It exits non-zero on the first failure.

Set `BASE_URL` to test another origin, and `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to use
non-default credentials.

---

## Deployment

1. Run `supabase/schema.sql` and set the Supabase variables (required — a
   serverless filesystem cannot persist the JSON adapter).
2. Set `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
3. `npm run build` → `npm start` (or deploy to any Next.js host).
4. Sign in at `/admin`, upload the portrait and publish the first case study.

`/admin` and `/api` are excluded from `robots.txt`, and the dashboard sets
`noindex`.
